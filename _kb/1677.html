<p>
 Currently, a DTR instance can only be associated with one UCP cluster (one-to-one mapping). Multiple UCP clusters can't share a single DTR instance.
</p>
<p>
 This configuration constraint my change in the future. In the meantime, it is possible to pull images from a DTR instance that's associated with one UCP cluster using a worker node in another cluster, however DTR/UCP integration features such as Docker Content Trust are only available to the UCP cluster associated with the DTR instance.
