{% raw %}
<p>
 There are stopped docker/ucp-agent containers named
 <code>
  ucp-reconcile
 </code>
 on my UCP nodes. What should I do about them?
</p>
<p>
 Leave them be. They are supposed to be there. UCP nodes have a stopped docker/ucp-agent container named
 <code>
  ucp-reconcile
 </code>
 that has the ability to execute
 <code>
  /bin/ucp-agent recon
 </code>
 . These containers are autogenerated by UCP and stay in a stopped state unless UCP needs to reconcile the state of the node within the cluster.
