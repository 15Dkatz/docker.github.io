      <p>
       <u>
        Identification Requirements
       </u>
       - You must provide a proper form of identification:
            One form of identification must be a VALID form of government-issued identification (e.g., Driver's License, State ID, Passport) which bears your signature, your full legal name, and your photograph.
              A second form of identification may be required. If required, such identification must have your signature and full legal name. All identification provided must match the name on the registration form and your Examination Eligibility Form.
              Failure to provide ALL required identification at the time of the examination is considered a missed appointment, and you will not be able to take the examination at such time. In such case, you will forfeit your examination fees.
              NOTE: If you recently changed your name, or if your last name includes a generation indicator (e.g., Jr., III), be sure that your name is the same on your education verification, your examination registration form, and each of your required forms of identification.
      </p>
      <p>
       <u>
        No-Show Policy
       </u>
       - You may start your exam up to 15 minutes prior to your scheduled appointment time. You MUST start your exam no later than 15 minutes after your scheduled appointment time. Failing to start your exam within 15 minutes of your scheduled appointment time will result in the system marking you as a No-Show and you will not be able to take your exam.

     <dt>

     </dd>
     <dt>
      Q: If I do not pass the exam, can I retake it?
