{% raw %}
<p>
 Docker hosts running the devicemapper storage driver default to a configuration mode known as
 <code>
  loop-lvm
 </code>
 . This mode uses sparse files to build the thin pool used by image and container snapshots. The mode is designed to work out-of-the-box with no additional configuration. UCP production deployments should not run under
 <code>
  loop-lvm
 </code>
 mode.
</p>
<p>
 The preferred configuration for UCP production deployments is
 <code>
  direct-lvm
 </code>
 . To configure
 <code>
  direct-lvm
 </code>
 , please check the following link:
