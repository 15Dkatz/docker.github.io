<p>
 When a user gains SSH access to a Docker for AWS or Azure node, in actuality the user's access is only within a SSH container deployed on the node. As a result, many non-Docker CLI commands are run within the container itself and not at a host level. Users can run CLI commands at the host level by performing an additional step as outlined in this article.

 <strong>
  Warning

 These steps are provided primarily to assist with debugging. Issuing commands at the root level CLI should be done with caution. Not all configuration changes made at the host level persists across reboots.

 <p>
  Before performing these steps, you must meet the following requirements:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Docker EE cluster deployed via Docker for AWS
  </li>
  <li>
   A UCP admin client bundle or SSH access to the nodes in a Docker for AWS cluster
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  OR
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Docker EE cluster deployed via Docker for Azure
  </li>
  <li>
   A UCP admin client bundle or SSH access to the nodes in a Docker for Azure cluster

  <p>
   To gain access to the host level of a Docker for AWS or Azure node via SSH, log into the Docker for AWS or Azure node using your Docker username and your private key file. After doing so, start a privileged container to enable shell access on the host using nsenter (

   <p>
    To gain access to the host level of a Docker for AWS or Azure node via the UCP admin client bundle, run the same command as mentioned previously but with a node constraint to specify which node you're targeting. For example, if you intend to run it on a node named
    <code>
     node1
    </code>
    :

  <pre>
docker run -it -e constraint:node==node1 --privileged --pid=host debian nsenter -t 1 -m -u -n -i sh </pre>
