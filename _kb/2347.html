<p>
 How does UCP self-signed TLS certificates get renewed? In addition to that, when can these certificates get renewed?
</p>
<p>
 UCP will attempt to regenerate the self-signed certificate in use at a random time between 50-80% of the time between when the ucp-agent service task starts on a UCP node and when the certificate expires, or five minutes before the certificate expires, whichever comes first.
</p>
<p>
 If you would like to replace the certificates generated by UCP, you can either

 or

 .
