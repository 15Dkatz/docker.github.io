 Yes, you can convert your Docker Hub/Cloud user account into an organization account.
</p>
<p>
 <strong>
  WARNING: Once the user account has been converted into an organization, this operation can not be undone or reverted to a user account.
 </strong>

  Prerequisites
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   The user account that you wish to convert must not be a member of any teams or organizations. If the user account belongs to any organizations, remove the account from all organizations. If the user account is the sole owner of any organization, either add someone to the "
   <strong>
    owners
   </strong>
   " team and then remove yourself from the organization,
   <strong>
    or
   </strong>
   delete the organization by opening a
   <a href="/kb/1587/" rel="internal" target="_blank" title="Technical Support">
    Customer Service Request
   </a>
   using the email address associated with the account and provide the Docker ID of the organization you wish to delete.
  </li>
  <li>
   You need to have a separate Docker user account ready to assign it as the owner of the organization during conversion. In other words, if you wish to convert your user account into an organization account and you do not have any other user accounts, you need to create a new user account to assign it as the owner of the new organization. At the bottom of the conversion page, enter the Docker ID of the new owner of the organization. This user account then becomes the first member of the "
   <strong>
    owners
   </strong>
   " team and has full administrative access to configure and manage the organization. You may add more users into the "
   <strong>
    owners
   </strong>
   " team later.
  </li>
 </ul>

  How It Works
 </h2>
 <p>
  Your user account will be converted into an organization account where all administrative duties are left to another user or group of users in the organization. Once the account conversion is done, you will be immediately logged out of the account and will no longer be able to log into this account. All administrative actions will be performed by the owners of the organizations (members of the "
  <strong>
   owners
  </strong>
  " group).

   Email Addresses
  </h3>
  <p>
   Email addresses for this account will be removed, freeing them up to be used for any other accounts. (You will be able to reuse the removed email address for another Docker user account.)

   Converting your account removes any associations to other services like GitHub or Atlassian Bitbucket. You will be able to link your external accounts to another Docker Hub user.
