  To assist you better, it is recommended that you provide a short summary of your Docker use case as well as a detailed description of the issue you are facing.
 </span>
</p>
<p>
 Additionally, it helps speed the troubleshooting process when information about your Docker configuration and host environment is provided. For Docker EE, this can be done by using a UCP support dump, which is an archive that contains UCP system logs and diagnostic information. To obtain a support dump:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Log into the UCP UI with an administrator account.
 </li>
 <li>
  On the top-right menu, click your username, and choose
  <strong>
   Support Dump
  </strong>
  . An archive will be downloaded via your browser after a brief time interval.
 </li>
</ol>
<p>
 If the user interface is not accessible, you may perform the following steps instead to obtain a single-node version of the UCP support dump:
</p>
<ol>
 <li>
  Obtain direct CLI access to the Docker daemon on a UCP manager node.
 </li>
 <li>
  On Linux nodes run the CLI support tool with the following command:
  <pre>

<code>docker container run --rm  \
  --name ucp --log-driver none \
  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  docker/ucp:2.2.2 \
  support  &gt; docker-support-$HOSTNAME.tgz</code></pre>
  On Windows worker nodes, run the following command to generate a local support dump:
  <pre>

<code>PS&gt; docker run --name windowssupport -v 'C:\ProgramData\docker\daemoncerts:C:\ProgramData\docker\daemoncerts' -v 'C:\Windows\system32\winevt\logs:C:\eventlogs:ro' docker/ucp-dsinfo-win; docker cp windowssupport:'C:\dsinfo' .; docker rm -f windowssupport</code></pre>
  This command creates a directory named
  <code>
   dsinfo
  </code>
  in your current directory. If you want an archive file, you need to create it from the
  <code>
   dsinfo
  </code>
  directory.
 </li>
</ol>
